# Strong and healthy

Notes on multiple points in health and plan to start living healthier.

## Current state

```
Weight: 87.5kg *[1]
Height: 186cm
Belly fat
No visible muscles except legs
Getting tired really fast
Pectus excavatum
Rib flare
```

I don't have any more measurements at this point but intuition of where the bottlenecks may be (also called easy wins).

## Preferred state

Improved strength, endurance, aspect and cognitive function. (general idea)

TODO: add specific criteria for the preferred state

In order to arrive from the current to the final state I'll will start looking at my body as a computer system and I'll start by learning every piece and benchmarking and trying to improve pieces at a time.

## Body

TODO: separate them

### **Testosterone**
A steroid androgen hormone that stimulates development of male secondary sexual characteristics, produced mainly in the testes and the adrenal cortex.

#### How it is produced

The command to release more testosterone is made by the hypothalamus and it's captured by the testicles which then produce and release more testosterone. Another releaser of testosterone are the adrenal glands which release a smaller amount of testosterone.

#### What it does

Anabolic effects of muscle growth and strength. It binds to receptors on the surface of muscle cells and stimulates protein synthesis to build the muscle after trauma during resistance training. Testosterone increases levels of growth hormone which the body produces in response to exercise. Growth hormone also plays a part in protein synthesis and muscle growth.

Studies found that the prevalence of osteoporosis in testosterone deficient males is double that of those with normal testosterone level. Testosterone reduces the osteoclastic activity, which is the breakdown of bone and increases the osteoblastic activity which is responsible for bone growth.

Testosterone increases your red blood cell count produced in the bone marrow, this allows a greater transport of oxygen around the body reducing the demand on the heart. A study has shown testosterone replacement reduces risk of heart attack by 24% and stroke by 36%.  This can be achieved naturally by performing resistance exercise to prevent low levels of testosterone.

Testosterone can help with controlling body fat percentage.
Testosterone is known to increase verbal memory, spatial abilities and mathematical reasoning. Men with higher levels of testosterone have shown to have a reduced incidence of Alzheimerâ€™s disease.

- Sperm production
- Genital transformation (I imagine during early age)
- Libido
- Thinking and behavior (competiveness)
- Beard and Body hair
- Skin (Acnee when having too much testosterone)
- Muscle mass
- Fat metabolism (more burns fat faster)
- Bone density
- Heart Health

#### How to naturally boost it

- Exercise and lift
- Eat Protein, Fat and Carbs
- Minimize stress and cortisol levels
- Vitamid D
- Zinc and Vitamin B (especially if deficient) (best improvements)
- Vitamin's A, C, E (more research needed)
- HQ Sleep
- Herbs: ashwagandha, Mucuna pruriens, shilajit and tongkat ali
- Healthy sex life
- Avoid alcohol and drug use
