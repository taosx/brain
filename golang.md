# Go - Programming Language

_Go is a statically typed, compiled programming language, it is syntactically similar to C, but with memory safety, garbage collection, structural typing, and CSP-style concurrency._

Picked up Go in 2015-2016 while building a performant CMS for a failed news website for the romanian market, called privilegiul.ro \[deleted\].
_edit: Before privilegiul I built a (simple) material tracking desktop software in combination with Electron and Go for a single factory._ 

Go really hits the sweet spot for building API's and software running on servers, it's simple to learn (the basics at least), write and get productive. It's fast enough for most usecases while being quite performant and scalable.
