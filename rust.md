# Rust - Programming Language

_Rust is a multi-paradigm programming language focused on performance and safety, especially safe concurrency. Rust is syntactically similar to C++, and provides memory safety without using garbage collection._

Started learning Rust seriously by reading the book at the start of August 2020 and finished after two weeks, previous to that I tried in the past but didn't manage to finish it.

Really interested for the role that Rust plays in the server world and especially webassembly (wasm) on the server.

**Server WebAssembly - Tracking:**
- [Krustlet](https://github.com/deislabs/krustlet) - k8s Kubelet in Rust for running WASM
- [Lucet](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/lucet) - Sandboxing WebAssembly Compiler
- [wasmtime](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime) - Standalone runtime for WebAssembly
